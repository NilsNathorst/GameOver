# Feedback from group 10
- Nice indentation.
- Nice file structure.
- In GameOverScene.js 23, remove unused code snippet.
- Some files are unused, like DS_Store. Maybe you should add this to your .gitignore.
- Many imports from assets directory, like in BootScene. Maybe you could use a program like TexturePackage to import the files i the same file.
- In BootScene.js 31, remove unused code snippet.
- In MultiScene.js 12, one comment in swedish.
- Good names on functions and variables through the projects.
- Nice that you use a BootScene to load resouce before the game starts.
- Maybe the TestScene should been removed or add to the .gitignore.
